# PHP:Vaccine reservation system
I use php to build a vaccine reservation system, users can register an account, log in and make an appointment for a vaccine. The user interface is very friendly, and there are strict restrictions on the number of appointments. The website also has an administrator account, which can perform background management, add dates, view appointments and other operations.
